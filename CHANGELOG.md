## [0.35.4]

- **Set `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-For` on proxied requests** — the `gtl serve` router and `gtl proxy` now set standard forwarding headers when proxying to backends. Fixes CSRF origin mismatches in Rails and other frameworks that compare the `Origin` header against `request.base_url` — previously the backend saw `http://` while the browser sent `https://`.

## [0.35.2]

- **`{router_url}` and `{router_domain}` env tokens** — the `env:` block in `.treeline.yml` now supports `{router_url}` (e.g. `https://salt-feature.prt.dev`) and `{router_domain}` (e.g. `prt.dev`). Use `{router_domain}` for composable values like Rails `config.hosts << ".{router_domain}"` or cookie domains. Use `localhost:{port}` for your app's canonical host — see README for guidance.

## [0.35.1]

- **Fix pfctl anchor install ordering** — `gtl serve install` wrote the pf anchor file *after* the `pfctl -n` dry-run validation, so the dry-run failed with "No such file or directory" and the entire install was skipped. The anchor is now written before validation.

## [0.35.0]

- **Complete worktree config loading** — all commands now load `.treeline.yml` from the worktree you're in: `gtl open`, `gtl tunnel`, `gtl db`, `gtl release`, `gtl refresh`, plus `--start` in `gtl new`/`gtl review`. Branch-specific config overrides work everywhere. Commands that create worktrees (`gtl new`, `gtl review`) read from the main repo before creation, then switch to the new worktree's config for setup and `--start`.
- **Env sync on `gtl start`** — fresh `gtl start` (no supervisor running) now re-reads `env:` from `.treeline.yml` and updates the env file (e.g. `.env.local`) before starting the server. Editor settings are also synced. No more stale env files after editing `.treeline.yml`.
- **Env sync on `gtl restart`** — `gtl restart` syncs the env file and pushes updated environment variables to the supervisor's in-memory env map before restarting. Both the env file and the child process env are up to date.
- **Stale command detection** — `gtl restart` now warns if `commands.start` in `.treeline.yml` differs from what the supervisor is running, with a hint to Ctrl+C and `gtl start` fresh.
- **`gtl env sync` command** — new subcommand that re-syncs the env file and editor settings from `.treeline.yml` without starting a server. For users who start their server outside of `gtl`.
- **`gtl env show` subcommand** — `gtl env` is now a parent command. The previous `gtl env` behavior is available as `gtl env show` (or just `gtl env` with no subcommand, which defaults to show). `gtl env --json` and `gtl env --template` continue to work.
- **`gtl worktree` command** — prints the worktree path for the current directory. Useful for scripting and agent tooling.
- **Default domain `prt.dev` for new installs** — new installs default to `prt.dev` instead of `localhost`. Existing installs are not affected — the CLI detects pre-existing configs and preserves `localhost`. `gtl serve install` now persists `router.domain` to `config.json`. See `docs/DOMAIN_MIGRATION.md` for details.
- **pfctl anchor recreation fix** — `gtl serve install` now checks that the pf anchor file exists, not just the pf.conf marker. Fixes "port forwarding skipped" errors after running `gtl serve uninstall` then `gtl serve install`.
- **`gtl refresh` uses worktree `port_count`** — `gtl refresh` detection now reads `port_count` from the worktree's `.treeline.yml` instead of the main repo's. Branch-specific port count changes are now detected correctly.

## [0.33.0]

- **`gtl worktrees`** — interactive TUI picker for worktrees, grouped by project. Arrow keys to navigate, Enter to print path. Alias: `gtl wt`.
- **`gtl where <branch>`** — print the path to a worktree by branch name. Searches across all projects in the registry. Use `project/branch` to disambiguate when multiple projects have the same branch.
- **Zero-config worktrees** — `gtl new` now works without a `.treeline.yml`. Detects the framework; if it's a server framework (Rails, Node, etc.), prompts to run init. For non-server projects (Go CLI, Rust library), creates a plain worktree with no allocation.
- **Branch protection** — `gtl release` warns if the worktree has unpushed commits before releasing, reducing accidental data loss.
- **Dynamic resolve links** — `gtl link` and `gtl unlink` now immediately regenerate the env file and restart the supervised server. Previously, links only updated the registry — the env file stayed stale until a manual `gtl refresh` or restart. The `--restart` flag is deprecated (restart is now automatic).
- **Safari warnings configurable** — removed Safari/hosts sync warnings from `gtl new`/`gtl setup` output (noise for non-Safari users). Warnings still appear in `gtl serve status`. Disable entirely with `gtl config set warnings.safari false`.
- **Editor title URL tokens** — `editor.title` template now supports `{url}` (e.g., `http://localhost:3010`) and `{router_url}` (e.g., `https://salt-feature.localhost`).

## [0.32.0]

- **Multi-domain tunnel support**— `gtl tunnel setup` now supports multiple Cloudflare domains. When the requested domain differs from your current credentials, gtl prompts to authenticate with the correct zone and stores per-domain certificates (`cert-{domain}.pem`). DNS routing uses `--origincert` to target the correct zone. After routing, gtl verifies the DNS record was created in the intended zone; if not, it provides clear manual CNAME instructions with the tunnel UUID.
- **Worktree removal safety** — `gtl release --remove-worktree` and `gtl prune --remove-worktree` now detect if you're inside the worktree being removed. Warns about directory invalidation, prompts for confirmation, and prints `cd` instructions for your terminal. IDE users are advised to close/switch workspaces.

## [0.31.0]

- **Port preservation** — default `port.base` changed from 3000 to 3002; default `port.increment` changed from 10 to 2. Common framework ports (3000, 4000, 5000, 8000, 8080, etc.) are now skipped by the allocator, keeping them free for the proxy to claim for origin-preserving routing. Third-party services (OAuth, Mapbox, Stripe) whitelisted for `localhost:3000` now work transparently across branches.
- **Router port conflict detection** — the allocator hard-fails if `port.base` equals `router.port`, preventing silent conflicts where worktree allocations block the proxy listener.
- **Port config warnings** — `gtl doctor` and `gtl init` warn when `port.base` is a common framework default or conflicts with the router port, with fix commands and a link to docs.
- **File permission hardening** — the config directory is created with mode `0700` (owner-only) and tightened on every CLI invocation. `config.json` and `registry.json` are written with mode `0600`. Lock files changed from `0644` to `0600`. Prevents other users on shared machines from reading credentials or manipulating the registry that drives proxy routing.
- **`gtl start` port wiring warning** — warns at start time (not just doctor/setup) when the start command is missing `{port}` for frameworks that ignore the `PORT` env var (Vite, Next.js, Django).
- **Resumable `gtl review` / `gtl new`** — when the branch already has a worktree, both commands now run setup if no allocation exists, print allocation info, and respect `--open`/`--start` flags instead of printing a dead-end message.

## [0.30.0]

- **Configurable worktree path** — set `worktree.path` in user config to control where `gtl new` and `gtl review` create worktrees. Template supports `{project}` and `{branch}` interpolation. Example: `"worktree": {"path": ".worktrees/{branch}"}` creates worktrees inside the repo instead of as siblings. Relative paths resolve from the repo root; absolute paths are used as-is. Default behavior (sibling directories) is unchanged.
- **Automatic `.gitignore` protection** — when worktree paths resolve inside the repo root, Treeline verifies the directory is gitignored before creating the worktree. If not, it appends the pattern to `.gitignore` automatically. Prevents accidentally committing worktree contents. Sibling paths (the default layout) skip this check.
- **Hop-counted loop detection** — the HTTPS router replaces the binary `X-Gtl-Proxy` header with a counted `X-Gtl-Hops` header, allowing up to 5 legitimate proxy hops before returning 508. Fixes false positives in multi-service setups where requests pass through the router more than once.
- **DNS label truncation** — route keys for long project/branch combinations are truncated to 63 characters (the DNS label limit) with a deterministic hash suffix, preventing routing failures for long branch names.
- **HTML error pages** — the router's 404 (route not found) and 508 (loop detected) responses are now styled HTML pages with dark mode support, available route listings, and framework-specific fix suggestions.
- **Atomic registry writes** — `registry.json` is now written via temp file + rename, preventing corruption from interrupted writes. Corrupt JSON is detected and reported as an error instead of being silently replaced.
- **CA auto-renewal** — `gtl serve install` and `EnsureCA` now regenerate the local CA certificate when it's within 7 days of expiry, preventing surprise HTTPS failures.
- **Browser blocked port avoidance** — the port allocator now skips ports on the WHATWG "bad port" list (e.g. 6000, 6665–6669) that browsers silently refuse to connect to.
- **Stale supervisor detection** — `gtl start` detects when a supervisor socket already exists and reports the conflict instead of silently failing.
- **Security hardening** — privileged operations (`pfctl`, `iptables`, `cp`) now use full binary paths to prevent PATH injection in sudo contexts. `SECURITY.md` rewritten to document the trust model and privileged operations.
- **Structured CLI errors** — all user-facing errors now use a `CliError` type with message, remediation hint, and optional docs link. Centralized formatting in the root command ensures consistent output across every command.
- **Config validation** — `WarnUnknownKeys` detects unrecognized keys in both user config and `.treeline.yml`, with Levenshtein-distance "did you mean?" suggestions for likely typos.
- **Guard tests** — static analysis tests using `go/parser` enforce architectural rules: no `os.Exit` in `internal/` or `cmd/RunE`, no `fmt.Print` in `internal/`. Catches violations at test time.
- **Git exec abstraction** — `gitRun`, `gitOutput`, `gitCheck` helpers in `internal/worktree` replace scattered `exec.Command("git", ...)` calls with consistent error handling.
- **Framework-aware port interpolation** — `{port}`, `{port_2}`, `{port_3}` tokens in start commands resolve to the allocated port block, supporting multi-port frameworks out of the box.
- **Alias routing** — the HTTPS router accepts alias sources for non-registry routes (e.g. Redis UI, Mailhog). Registry routes override aliases on collision.
- **`/etc/hosts` sync** — `gtl serve hosts sync` writes entries for all active routes to `/etc/hosts`, enabling Safari compatibility (Safari doesn't resolve `*.localhost` to loopback).
- **Configurable router domain** — `router.domain` in user config changes the base domain from `localhost` to a custom value (e.g. `dev.local`).
- **macOS CI** — platform-specific packages (proxy, service, supervisor) now run on macOS in CI.

## [0.29.0]

- **`gtl dashboard`** — interactive TUI for monitoring and managing all worktrees in real time. Two-panel layout with project-grouped worktree list and live detail view. Keyboard-driven: start/stop/restart supervisors, open in browser, release worktrees with confirmation, filter search, and help overlay. Mouse support included. Accessible via `gtl dashboard`, `gtl dash`, or `gtl ui`. Built on Bubble Tea v2.

## [0.28.1]

- **`gtl tunnel remove <name>`** — remove a named tunnel from local config. If the removed tunnel was the default and other tunnels remain, another is promoted automatically. If it was the last tunnel, gtl falls back to quick tunnels (random URLs). Does not delete the Cloudflare tunnel itself.

## [0.28.0]

- **`gtl env`** — print the current worktree's environment. Default output shows every key from the env file, with Treeline-managed keys annotated `[treeline]`. `--json` for structured output. `--template` shows unresolved interpolation tokens instead of final values.
- **Port conflict detection on reuse** — `gtl setup` now checks `IsPortFree` when reusing an existing allocation. If any port is occupied (e.g. another process grabbed it since last allocation), Treeline automatically re-allocates to a free block, updates the registry, and prints a warning. Treeline never hands back a port it cannot actually use.
- **Shell completions** — `gtl completion bash|zsh|fish|powershell` outputs completion scripts. Homebrew installs completions automatically. Dynamic completions added for `gtl config get/set` (common config keys) and `gtl status --project` (project names).
- **`gtl start --await`** — blocks until the server is accepting TCP connections on its allocated port, then exits 0. Designed for agents and CI scripts that need to wait for readiness before hitting the server. `--await-timeout` sets the deadline in seconds (default 60). Works on both fresh start and resume (when the supervisor is already running).
- **`gtl open`** — opens the current worktree in the browser. Prefers `https://{project}-{branch}.localhost` when `gtl serve` is running; falls back to `http://localhost:{port}`. Always opens the primary port.
- **`gtl clone`** — clone a repo and set up Treeline in one step. Passes all flags through to `git clone`, detects the framework, generates `.treeline.yml` if absent, and runs `gtl setup`. Deliberately does not auto-start — cloning a foreign repo and running arbitrary shell commands is a trust boundary.
- **Lifecycle hooks** — `.treeline.yml` now supports `pre_setup`, `post_setup`, `pre_release`, and `post_release` hooks. Pre-hooks abort the operation on failure; post-hooks warn and continue. Hook ordering: allocate → env → DB → `pre_setup` → `commands.setup` → editor → `post_setup`. Release: confirm → `pre_release` → free/drop → `post_release`.
- **`gtl resolve`** — look up another worktree's URL by project name. Uses same-branch matching by default: if your frontend and API repos both have `feature-auth` checked out, `{resolve:api}` in an env template resolves to `http://127.0.0.1:{api-port}` automatically. Override with `gtl resolve api staging` or `{resolve:api/staging}` in templates. Supports `--json` for scripting.
- **`gtl link` / `gtl unlink`** — runtime resolve overrides stored in the registry. `gtl link api staging` redirects all `{resolve:api}` lookups to the `staging` branch instead of the same-branch default. Survives restarts and `gtl refresh`. Visible in `gtl status` and `gtl doctor`. Use `--restart` to bounce the supervised server after linking. `gtl unlink api` reverts to the default.
- **`{resolve:project}` interpolation** — new env template token. Resolved at setup time using the registry. Supports `{resolve:project}` (same-branch default) and `{resolve:project/branch}` (explicit branch). Fails setup with a clear error if the target is not allocated.
- **Links visibility** — `gtl status` and `gtl doctor` now display active link overrides for each worktree.

## [0.27.0]

- **`gtl share`** — private branch sharing via token-gated URLs. Creates a Cloudflare tunnel fronted by an auth proxy: the recipient opens the link, gets a session cookie, and sees clean URLs from there. Tokens are ephemeral — new token and tunnel hostname on every run, everything destroyed on Ctrl+C. Uses your configured domain when a named tunnel is available; falls back to `*.trycloudflare.com` otherwise.
- **`gtl share --tailscale`** — alternative Tailscale Serve backend for tailnet-only sharing. No tokens needed — Tailscale handles identity-based auth with WireGuard encryption. Only people on your tailnet can reach the URL. Detects Tailscale from PATH or the macOS app bundle. Mutually exclusive with `--tunnel`.
- **Multi-tunnel config** — store multiple named tunnel configurations with a default, like rbenv. `gtl tunnel setup` now adds to your tunnel list; `gtl tunnel default <name>` switches the active config. Both `gtl tunnel` and `gtl share` accept `--tunnel <name>` to override the default. Old single-tunnel configs (`tunnel.name`/`tunnel.domain`) are auto-migrated.

## [0.26.0]

- **`--json` everywhere** — `gtl doctor`, `gtl port`, and `gtl db name` now accept `--json` for structured output. `gtl status --json` auto-probes port listening and supervisor state without requiring `--check`.
- **`gtl new` shows serve URL** — after creating a worktree, `gtl new` prints the HTTPS router URL when `gtl serve` is running, matching the behavior of `gtl setup`.
- **Tunnel host hints** — `gtl tunnel` detects the project framework and prints the exact config change needed to whitelist the tunnel domain. Covers Rails (`config.hosts`), Vite (`server.allowedHosts`), and Django (`ALLOWED_HOSTS`). Named tunnels show the wildcard for your domain; quick tunnels suggest `.trycloudflare.com`.

## [0.25.0]

- **AI agent integration** — git-treeline now speaks MCP (Model Context Protocol). Add it to your editor's MCP config and agents can query allocations, check health, read config, get database names, and control the dev server — all via structured JSON. Exposes 9 tools and 2 resources.
- **Config rename** — `ports_needed` renamed to `port_count`. Existing configs are auto-migrated on load with a deprecation warning.

## [0.21.0]

- **Editor auto-detection** — `gtl init` detects which editor is running (Cursor, VS Code, Zed, JetBrains products) via terminal env vars or PATH probing, and stores `editor.name` in user config. Used by the menulet for "Open in Editor" labels. Falls back gracefully — if detection fails, no name is stored and the menulet hides the link.
- **Editor customization** — new `editor.title`, `editor.color`, and `editor.theme` config in `.treeline.yml` replace the old `editor.vscode_title`. Auto-migrated on first load.
  - `title`: window title template with `{project}`, `{port}`, `{branch}` interpolation
  - `color`: title/status/activity bar color — `"auto"` generates a deterministic color from the branch name, or set an explicit hex value. User config overrides via `editor.colors` in `config.json`.
  - `theme`: full IDE theme override (e.g. `"Monokai"`). User config overrides via `editor.themes` in `config.json`.
- **Workspace file detection** — when a `.code-workspace` file references the worktree, editor settings are written there (required for multi-root workspaces in VS Code/Cursor). Falls back to `.vscode/settings.json` for single-folder projects.
- **JetBrains support** — if `.idea/` exists, `editor.color` sets the project header color in `workspace.xml` (JetBrains 2023.2+).
- **User-level editor overrides** — `config.json` supports `editor.themes` and `editor.colors` maps keyed by `project` or `project/branch` for per-repo or per-branch IDE customization.
- **Port reservations** — pin stable ports to projects or specific branches via `port.reservations` in user config. Project-level keys (`salt: 3000`) apply to the main repo; `project/branch` keys (`salt/staging: 3020`) pin a specific branch and take priority. Reserved ports block the full `port.increment` range so dynamic allocations never collide.
- **`gtl refresh`** — re-allocate all registered worktrees with current config and reservations in one shot. Supervised servers are restarted automatically; manually-started servers are flagged for manual restart. Supports `--dry-run` and `--force`.
- **`gtl port`** — prints the allocated port for the current worktree. Designed for agents and scripts that need the port without parsing status output.
- **`AGENTS.md` integration** — `gtl init` now writes a treeline section to `AGENTS.md` (works with Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex) instead of `.cursor/rules/treeline.mdc`. Appends to existing `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, or creates `AGENTS.md` if neither exists. Includes `gtl port` as the primary port discovery instruction.
- **Reservation-aware reuse** — `gtl setup` now detects when an existing allocation's port doesn't match a reservation (or conflicts with another project's reservation) and automatically re-allocates instead of reusing stale ports.
- **Fix: stale port reuse** — re-running `gtl setup` after changing `port_count` in config now correctly re-allocates instead of reusing the old port count.
- **Fix: `ProjectDefaults` env_file** — defaults now use the string shorthand form, matching the canonical config shape.
- **Self-documenting templates** — `gtl init` generates `.treeline.yml` with commented-out optional config (port_count, Redis, editor, etc.) so available features are discoverable without reading docs. `port_count: 2` is never auto-emitted as active config.

## [0.19.0]

### New

- **`gtl switch`** — switch a worktree to a different branch or PR in one step. Accepts branch names or PR numbers (resolved via `gh`). Fetches from origin, checks out the branch, updates the registry, and refreshes the env file. Use `--setup` to re-run `commands.setup` after switching.
- **`gtl doctor`** — check project config, allocation, runtime, and diagnostics in one view. Reports on `.treeline.yml` presence, env file status, port allocation, supervisor state, and framework-specific guidance.
- **Tab completion** — `gtl new`, `gtl review`, and `gtl switch` now provide shell completions for branch names and PR numbers.
- **`gtl release` confirmation** — single-worktree releases now show what will be released and prompt for confirmation. Use `--force` to skip.
- **Worktree guard** — `gtl new` and `gtl review` now error if run from inside a worktree (which would create confusing sibling worktrees). Suggests `gtl switch` or navigating to the main repo instead.

### Changed

- **Simplified `env_file` config** — `env_file: .env.local` now works as a string shorthand (replaces the old `target:`/`source:` map). For cases where the written file differs from the seed, use `path:`/`seed_from:`. Old configs are auto-migrated on first load.
- Templates now emit the simplified `env_file` string form.

## [0.18.0]

### New

- **`gtl start` injects env vars** — the supervisor now reads the worktree's allocation from the registry, resolves env templates from `.treeline.yml`, and passes them into the child process environment. `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc. are available as real env vars without requiring the app to read `.env` files.
- **Vite detection** — `gtl init` recognizes Vite projects (`vite.config.js/ts/mjs`) and generates a tailored `.treeline.yml` with `npx vite` start command and `.env.local` wiring
- **Post-init/setup diagnostics** — `gtl init` and `gtl setup` now print actionable warnings:
  - Vite: explains `vite.config.js` + `loadEnv` port wiring
  - Node without dotenv: warns that `.env` won't be auto-read, suggests install
  - Python without python-dotenv: same pattern
  - Go/Rust: suggests sourcing env file in start command
  - Missing `env_file` block when `env` vars are configured
- **Smarter env_file emission** — templates now emit `env_file` for frameworks that natively load env files (Next.js, Vite, Rails) even when no `.env` file exists yet on disk
- **dotenv detection** — detects `dotenv`, `dotenv-cli`, `python-dotenv`, `django-environ` in dependency files

## [0.17.0]

### Breaking

- `setup_commands` → `commands.setup` and `start_command` → `commands.start` in `.treeline.yml`
- Auto-migration: existing configs with old keys are rewritten on first load — no manual cleanup needed
- Generated templates now include `commands.start` per framework (Next.js, Rails, Node, Python)

## [0.16.0]

- `gtl start` / `gtl stop` / `gtl restart` — supervised dev server
  - `start` runs `start_command` from `.treeline.yml` under a Unix socket supervisor
  - `stop` pauses the server; supervisor stays alive for resume
  - `start` (again) resumes the server in the original terminal
  - `restart` atomic bounce — stop + start in one step
  - Ctrl+C in the terminal fully exits the supervisor
- Hardened supervisor: socket permissions (0600), read deadlines, `sync.Once` on shutdown, 30s client timeout

## [0.15.0]

- `gtl db` command group for worktree database management:
  - `db name` — print the worktree's database name
  - `db reset` — drop and re-clone from template
  - `db reset --from <db>` — clone from a different local database
  - `db restore <file>` — restore from pg_dump (auto-detects custom format vs plain SQL)
  - `db drop` — drop without re-cloning
- Document port-dependent data pattern (setup_commands for OAuth/webhook fixups)

## [0.14.1]

- Homebrew: `gtl` alias available via `brew install git-treeline`

## [0.14.0]

- Drop git-treeline-rails gem reference

## [0.13.0]

### Breaking

- Rename `default_branch` → `merge_target` in `.treeline.yml`
- Auto-migration: existing configs with `default_branch` are rewritten to `merge_target` on first load — no manual cleanup needed
- If both keys exist, `merge_target` wins and `default_branch` is silently removed

## [0.12.0]

- Smarter env file detection: `init` finds which env file actually exists (`.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env`, etc.) instead of hardcoding per framework
- Interactive env file selection: confirms single match, prompts to choose when multiple found
- Framework-specific port wiring hints printed after `init` (Next.js, Node, Python)
- Port guidance included in generated agent context files (`treeline.mdc`, `CLAUDE.md`)

## [0.11.0]
