# Git Treeline

Worktree environment manager — isolated ports, databases, and services across parallel development environments.

## Why

Git worktrees let you check out multiple branches side by side. That's always been possible. What's changed is scale.

AI coding agents work in worktrees. You might have three agents building features in parallel, each in its own worktree — and when they're done, you need to *run* each one to review the work. Boot the server, click through the UI, verify the behavior. You can't review what you can't run, and you can't run three copies of the same app when they're all fighting over port 3000.

The problem gets worse when your app needs a database, Redis, or other local services — but the simplest case is just ports. If you run `next dev` in three worktrees, they all want port 3000. Git Treeline gives each one its own.

## How it works

Git Treeline has two layers of configuration and a central registry.

**Project config** (`.treeline.yml`, committed to your repo) describes what the project needs: port allocation, env vars to set, and optionally database cloning and setup commands.

**User config** (`config.json`, on your machine) controls allocation policy: port range and increment. This is per-developer, not per-project — it governs how resources are handed out across everything on your machine.

**The registry** (`registry.json`) is the ledger. When you run `git-treeline setup`, it allocates the next available port block, writes your env file, and records the allocation. When you run `git-treeline release`, it frees those resources. `git-treeline status` shows everything allocated across all projects.

For projects that need it, Treeline can also clone PostgreSQL databases from a template and assign Redis namespaces — but those are opt-in.

## Install

### From source (requires Go 1.22+)

```bash
go install github.com/git-treeline/git-treeline@latest
```

### From release binary

Download the latest binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/git-treeline/git-treeline/releases), extract, and place on your `PATH`.

## Quick start

### 1. Initialize your project

```bash
cd your-project
git-treeline init --project myapp
```

This creates `.treeline.yml` — commit it so your team shares the same config. Edit it to match your needs (see [Framework examples](#framework-examples)).

### 2. Set up a worktree

```bash
git worktree add ../myapp-feature-x feature-x
git-treeline setup ../myapp-feature-x
```

Git Treeline will:
- Allocate the next available port (3010, 3020, etc.)
- Write your env file with the allocated values
- Run your setup commands (`npm install`, `bundle install`, etc.)
- Optionally clone your database and assign a Redis namespace

### 3. Boot the worktree

```bash
cd ../myapp-feature-x
npm run dev    # or bin/dev, or whatever starts your app
```

Your app reads `PORT` from the env file and starts on 3010. The main copy runs on 3000. No collisions.

### 4. Check what's allocated

```bash
git-treeline status
```

```
myapp:
  :3010  feature-x
  :3020  bugfix-y

api-service:
  :3030  experiment  db:api_development_experiment
```

### 5. Release when done

```bash
git-treeline release ../myapp-feature-x
git worktree remove ../myapp-feature-x
```

## Framework examples

Git Treeline is framework-agnostic. The `.treeline.yml` config adapts to your stack.

### Next.js

```yaml
project: myapp

env_file:
  target: .env.local
  source: .env.local

env:
  PORT: "{port}"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL: "http://localhost:{port}"

setup_commands:
  - npm install
```

Next.js reads `PORT` from `.env.local` automatically. That's all most Next apps need.

### Next.js with Prisma + Postgres

```yaml
project: myapp

env_file:
  target: .env.local
  source: .env.local

env:
  PORT: "{port}"
  DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://localhost:5432/{database}"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL: "http://localhost:{port}"

database:
  adapter: postgresql
  template: myapp_development
  pattern: "{template}_{worktree}"

setup_commands:
  - npm install
  - npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Node.js / Express

```yaml
project: myapi

env_file:
  target: .env
  source: .env.example

env:
  PORT: "{port}"

setup_commands:
  - npm install
```

### Rails

```yaml
project: myapp
ports_needed: 2

env_file:
  target: .env.local
  source: .env.local

database:
  adapter: postgresql
  template: myapp_development
  pattern: "{template}_{worktree}"

copy_files:
  - config/master.key

env:
  PORT: "{port}"
  DATABASE_NAME: "{database}"
  REDIS_URL: "{redis_url}"
  ESBUILD_PORT: "{port_2}"
  APPLICATION_HOST: "localhost:{port}"

setup_commands:
  - bundle install --quiet
  - yarn install --silent
```

For automatic ENV injection at Rails boot, see [git-treeline-rails](https://github.com/git-treeline/git-treeline-rails).

### Frontend SPA (no server resources)

```yaml
project: dashboard

env_file:
  target: .env.local
  source: .env.local

env:
  PORT: "{port}"

setup_commands:
  - npm install
```

## Configuration

### User config (`config.json`)

Controls allocation policy for your machine. Created automatically by `git-treeline init` or `git-treeline config`.

```json
{
  "port": {
    "base": 3000,
    "increment": 10
  },
  "redis": {
    "strategy": "prefixed",
    "url": "redis://localhost:6379"
  }
}
```

User config and registry live at the platform-appropriate location:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/git-treeline/` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git-treeline/` (defaults to `~/.config/git-treeline/`) |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/git-treeline/` |

### Project config (`.treeline.yml`)

See [Framework examples](#framework-examples) for complete examples. Available fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `project` | Project name (defaults to directory name) |
| `ports_needed` | Number of contiguous ports per worktree (default: 1) |
| `env_file.target` | Env file written in the worktree |
| `env_file.source` | Env file copied from main repo as a starting point |
| `database.adapter` | `postgresql` (only supported adapter for template cloning) |
| `database.template` | Source database to clone from (omit if no DB needed) |
| `database.pattern` | Naming pattern — `{template}_{worktree}` |
| `copy_files` | Files copied from main repo to worktree |
| `env` | Key-value pairs written to the env file, with token interpolation |
| `setup_commands` | Shell commands run in the worktree after setup |
| `editor.vscode_title` | VS Code window title template |

### Interpolation tokens

Available in `env` values:

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| `{port}` | First allocated port |
| `{port_N}` | Nth allocated port (e.g. `{port_2}`) |
| `{database}` | Database name (if configured) |
| `{redis_url}` | Full Redis URL |
| `{redis_prefix}` | Redis key prefix (if using prefixed strategy) |
| `{project}` | Project name |
| `{worktree}` | Worktree name |

## Database cloning (optional)

If your project uses PostgreSQL, Treeline can clone your development database per-worktree using `createdb --template`. This gives each worktree its own database with zero migration overhead.

Set `database.template` in your `.treeline.yml` to enable this. Omit it entirely if your project doesn't need database isolation, or if you use migrations instead (e.g. `npx prisma migrate deploy` in `setup_commands`).

Use `--drop-db` with `git-treeline release` to clean up cloned databases.

## Redis namespacing (optional)

If your project uses Redis, Treeline can assign each worktree its own namespace to prevent key collisions.

**Prefixed** (default): All worktrees share Redis DB 0, keys are namespaced (`myapp:feature-x:...`). No limit on concurrent worktrees.

**Database**: Each worktree gets its own Redis DB number (1-15). Use this if your app doesn't support key prefixing.

Configure in your user config under `redis.strategy`.

## Use with AI agents

Git Treeline is designed to support AI coding agents that work in worktrees. Any tool that creates worktrees — Conductor, Claude Code, custom scripts — can use Treeline to ensure each worktree gets isolated resources.

### Lifecycle hooks

Most agent frameworks support setup/teardown hooks:

```bash
# On worktree creation
git-treeline setup .

# On worktree teardown
git-treeline release . --drop-db
```

### Programmatic access

Use `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
git-treeline status --json
```

This returns the full registry as JSON — allocated ports, databases, Redis namespaces, and worktree paths. Useful for agent orchestrators that need to know what's running where.

### Conductor

```json
{
  "setup": "git-treeline setup .",
  "archive": "git-treeline release . --drop-db"
}
```
